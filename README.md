# MSX-vi

A vi text editor clone for the MSX 8-bit home computer.

## Description

MSX-vi is a clone of the vi text editor for the MSX computer.

MSX is a 8-bit computer system created in 1983 by Microsoft and ASCII
Corporation. It was very popular in Japan, some European countries, Korea and
Brazil. Although it's not widely used nowadays, it still has a great number of
enthusiasts creating hardware and software for the platform.

Vi is a text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. It became
very popular and today there are many different clones available on multiple
platforms.

## Minimum requirements

* MSX2 computer (or emulator)
* MSX-DOS2

## History

My passion for technology started when my parents gave me as a present my first
computer. I was 9 years old and the computer was a MSX. At the beginning I was
using it just to play games, but I started learning programming by myself
(first Logo and Basic later). Nowadays I still enjoy playing with MSX and
trying to learn better how it works internally.

Thanks to Javi Lavandeira's tutorials
[Relearning MSX](https://www.lavandeira.net/relearning-msx/) on how to program
with C for the MSX, I started writing my first programs and tests, and I
started to have the idea on writing a vi clone. As far as I know there is
nothing similar on the MSX.

I started writing code, but a text editor is way more complex than it looks.
Memory management was very difficult for my limited C knowledge. At the end I
abandoned the project.

Few months later I discovered the
[Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)
tutorial. It is a step by step guide on how to write Antirez's
[kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) text editor. I started reading it and I
decided to try again writing the vi clone for MSX.
